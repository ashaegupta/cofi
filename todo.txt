## CACHING DATA


## ICONS TO DEMO DATA

## Nice to have
- clean up local storage data 
- remove the extra zoom - DONE
- square buttons - DONE
- show address with place name in fs_list
- add comments
- when creating a mongo update doc across multiple methods, make sure you don't overwrite keys created in one method in another, e.g. '$set' in Place.add_place
- use docstrings for each method instead of comments above
- raise exceptions instead of returning an error dictionary. use try/except clauses to catch exceptions and process them into json for returning
- import necessary functions from MongoMixin; get rid of class structure in Place
