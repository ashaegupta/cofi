cofi.py notes
=============

## features to add
- format yelp API responses to match database responses
- add GET handlers to cofi.py; integrate responses from database and APIs
- add POST handlers to cofi.py
- write find method in Place.py

## fixes
- when creating a mongo update doc across multiple methods, make sure you don't overwrite keys created in one method in another, e.g. '$set' in Place.add_place
- use docstrings for each method instead of comments above
- raise exceptions instead of returning an error dictionary. use try/except clauses to catch exceptions and process them into json for returning
